				<h3>Who Am I?</h3>
				<p>My name is <strong>Peter the Gopher</strong>. I am a western pocket gopher, also known as <em>thomomys mazama</em>.</p>
				<p>I was born to Doug the Gopher and Tina the Gopher. I also have three siblings (Sharlene, Lance, and Charles) and eleven cousins (Wilda, Matilda, Zelda, Michael, Mitchell, Bonnie, Evan, Gregory, and the triplets, Harry, Jerry, and Barry). My best friends are Mo the Mouse and Billy the Beetle.</p>
				<p>When in my secret-agent alter ego, I am despised by my enemies. I steal eggs from hawks and hide them in snake dens.</p>
